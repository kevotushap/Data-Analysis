Meet Jackie and Harold owners of Vitality Bowls in Orlando, FL. What inspired you to purchase a franchise such as Vitality Bowls? “We love the idea of not recreating the wheel. Vitality Bowls is an established brand with a network of nationwide franchisees and a proven business model. After researching several business opportunities, Vitality Bowls embraced our lifestyle and our passion with the healthy tasty menu, clean look and feel of the cafe, and transparent kitchen layout.” What makes your business different from other health food establishments? “Vitality Bowls was created out of a strong commitment to bringing health and wellness to every community across the country through fresh, high-quality superfoods. Vitality Bowls specializes in making delicious açaí bowls, which are a thick blend of the açaí berry topped with organic granola and a selection of superfood ingredients. Additional antioxidant-rich menu items include smoothies, fresh juices, soups, salads, and panini. All items on the menu are made fresh to order and in a kitchen designed to avoid cross-contamination of common food allergens. No ingredient fillers such as ice, frozen yogurt, or artificial preservatives are used, giving the purest taste possible to each item.” What are a few ways in which your business demonstrates corporate responsibility in the community? “We were honored to receive the Leader Out of Necessity Award from the West Orange Chamber of Commerce for our support to our first responders and community partners. In 2010 we donated over 1300 smoothies and over 850 healthy meals to Police Stations, Fire Stations, Hospitals, and more! We support with givebacks to local Schools (Free Smoothie Certificates rewarding Students and Teachers), Churches, Charities such as MilesToGo and Matthews Hope.

In 2001, Nasdaq filed its official application to register as an independent national securities exchange with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and about a year later, the SEC formally approved Nasdaq’s application to become a registered national securities exchange, which allowed Nasdaq to begin operations as a self-regulatory organization and fully divest itself from the NASD’s control.

As the caregiver for her husband who has dementia, Humana member Irena knows this all too well. ?????? In 2019, stress was draining her emotionally and driving up her blood pressure. That’s when Irena learned about a class at her Humana Neighborhood Center called “Helping a loved one with dementia” and began working with Humana Neighborhood Center health educator Ada. She listened to Irena’s concerns and suggested healthy, stress-reducing strategies that helped her become the best possible caregiver to her husband—and herself. ?????????? One suggestion from Ada that Irena especially connected to was journaling. Through journal keeping, Irena found new ways to connect with her husband—like watching travel videos of places they’d visited together. After several weeks, both her stress level and blood pressure had gone down. And although COVID-19 has kept her local Humana Neighborhood Center closed, virtual offerings, as well as Ada’s strategies, have continued to help Irena stay healthier. ???? Irena also started collecting positive quotes in her journal, including one she shared with Ada in appreciation: “Health does not always come from medicine. Most of the time it comes from peace of mind, peace in heart, peace of soul. It comes from laughter and love.” ??????

This extreme winter weather impacted much of the KCS network from Missouri south to Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas and even northern Mexico, grinding some aspects of normal life to a halt with ice-covered and closed roads, power and water outages, fuel station shortages and closures, and empty store shelves. While facing challenges with their own homes and families, many employees worked tirelessly to help their fellow KCS employees, employees from other railroads, and customers to help maintain and restore vital services to customers and the greater community. KCS had an all-hands on deck approach to clean switches and walkways, maintain equipment, facilities and critical IT infrastructure, and provide alternative and temporary accommodations for rest where normal resources were not available. “As proven many times before, when weather impacts the operation, KCS people do whatever must be done to restore and maintain vitally important service to customers and the greater community,” said KCS executive vice president and chief operating officer Jeff Songer. “When looking at the many heroic actions that were taken and personal sacrifices made, and knowing there were many more unreported, it paints a picture of the pride, dedication and commitment employees have to KCS’ vision and values.

Last week we shared threads to offer more understanding into intermittent outages & what will happen to your bill next month. Today we want to empower you with a thread of 10 ways to save and become more energy efficient. 1. You can't always predict the highs and lows of Midwest weather ?? ??? ?? ??? ? , but you can average out your monthly bill with our Average Payment Plan. https://www.evergy.com/manage-account/billing/payment-options/average-payment-plan 2. You can get rewarded with rate discounts ?? when you shift your weekday energy use to off-peak times, like after 8 p.m. This means running your dishwasher and washer and dryer during off-peak hours. Eligible Missouri customers can learn more about this plan here: https://www.evergy.com/manage-account/rate-information/plan-options/time-of-use-plan 3. Enroll in our Thermostat Program. We’re currently offering the ecobee3 lite for free to eligible Missouri customers. As part of the program, you can participate in Energy Savings Events (which you can choose to opt out of). These events help manage energy usage on select days of extreme heat when everyone is cranking up their air conditioner. https://www.evergy.com/landing/easy-to-install-smart-thermostats 4. During the winter ?? lowering your settings by 1 degree for at least eight hours will save you about 1% on your energy bill. During the summer, each degree you set your thermostat above 75 degrees cuts your cooling costs by about 3%. 5. Incandescent bulbs use more energy that LED bulbs. If you replace them with high efficiency fixtures, they’ll use 90% less energy and last 15 times longer. You can also take advantage of natural light by opening shades and blinds, reducing the need for electric lighting. 6. Invest in smart power strips. ?? ?? A smart strip can detect when devices are in standby or powered off. They’ll cut off power to devices in standby or powered off to save energy. Allows a person to set it and forget it. 7. Standby power loss accounts for as much as 20% of your bill. Leaving items plugged in like your ?? cell phone charger and cable box will use power even when you’re not using them. 8. If you’re a gamer or a parent of a gamer ?? , know that your gaming console uses 10x more power than a tablet or laptop. Make sure to unplug it when it’s not in use. 9. If you wash clothes in cold water, it can save you about 50 cents per load. That adds up over a month. 10. You want to change your furnace filter every three months and also clean and change your air filters monthly. This will allow air to properly flow and ensure that your furnace and air conditioner are working at peak efficiency. ?? ??

I don't feel comfortable.” In honor of #RareDiseaseDay, we asked Ashley P., who lives with #BehcetsDisease, to tell us about her journey. This is what she had to say: “After countless months of visits to the emergency room and working with my primary care physician, OB-GYN and an infectious disease doctor, I was met with this dead-end phrase while speaking with a rheumatologist. My journey with Behçet’s Disease started when I was 19, and I’m still on it. I was misdiagnosed repeatedly, and I knew we weren’t getting to the root of the issue. So, after hearing that disheartening phrase from the rheumatologist, from then on, I had to become my own quarterback. I found my own doctors, did my own research, purchased literature on Behçet’s Disease, learned about it that way. It took me three years and over 30 doctors to actually get the correct diagnosis. I was told I was crazy, my symptoms are psychosomatic, and I'm causing this to myself. Now I know that my symptoms, like oral ulcers, were due to Behçet’s Disease, a rare, chronic, inflammatory condition that can affect multiple systems in the body and can manifest itself in a variety of symptoms. I had to be my own advocate. I had to fight. Since then, I've learned to slow down and take it easy. I can't compare myself now to my old body. In some ways, this journey has given me the mental strength that I have today. I always, always tell someone going through the same struggle to look for outside support groups, places like social media, that’s where I found my support. If you ever find someone that's near you connect with them, make friends with them, and you'll feel less alone.” National Organization for Rare Disorders, Inc.

Ostracized and threatened with violence, she never missed a day of school that year and eventually went on to business school to study travel and tourism. In 1999, she established The Ruby Bridges Foundation to end racism and promote tolerance, respect, and appreciation of differences through education. In 2000, she was made an honorary deputy marshal in a ceremony in Washington, D.C. When we reflect on the difficult moments of the past, we can face the difficult moments of today armed with knowledge, compassion, and action to ensure these events are not repeated.

In 2015, Gregg and his wife traveled to China to adopt Ellie, now 10. “When we adopted Ellie, she was an orphan and too young to have a real understanding of her heritage, so our Lunar New Year celebration serves as an opportunity for us all to learn more about China.” Gregg and his wife spent two weeks in China to complete the adoption process. During that time, they immersed themselves in the culture, learning about Chinese history and sampling traditional foods so that they could share their knowledge with Ellie. “We celebrated our first Lunar New Year a few months after we brought Ellie home, so it serves as a sort of anniversary of when she completed our family.” Gregg says that since they don't have much extended family nearby, their celebration plans haven't changed much from prior years. “It will just be the four of us, small and intimate.” To create a festive environment, the family decorates the house with Chinese lanterns. They enjoy dishes from their favorite local Chinese restaurant which they eat with chopsticks purchased in China. He also gives the children educational books about Lunar New Year and small cash gifts in red envelopes per the tradition. #LunarNewYear #CommunityBank",https://www.facebook.com/MandTBank/photos/a.242738599069601/4210220078988080/?type=3,,"Gregg Gre Moore Business Banking Relationship Manage Buffalo,NY",Timeline Photos,,,,,-1.09

Robert L. Milloy joined the Southern Railway in 1950. He grew up in Laurel, Mississippi, and—after a short stint working in his uncle’s funeral home—enlisted in the U. S. Army at age 20 and served in World War II. In 1947, he married his wife, Lorene, and settled in Birmingham, Alabama. Milloy worked for the railroad as a laborer, a hostler, and a fireman before becoming a locomotive engineer. In 1972, when this photograph was taken, his duties included keeping trains moving between Birmingham, Alabama, and Atlanta, Georgia. Hardworking and dedicated railroad employees—then and now—make things happen. Behind every Norfolk Southern train is an extensive network of track and terminals, a fleet of sophisticated locomotives and freight cars, and a team of employees who work around the clock to provide safe and reliable rail transportation.

Milloy have always kept the trains rolling. #respect #blackhistorymonth",https://www.facebook.com/norfolksouthern/photos/a.378480492547/10158062503392548/?type=3,,,,,,,,6.02

Create the Good knew the farm families who own Cabot Creamery Co-operative would be the perfect partners in the Honoring Heroes Contest because they have always believed in the value of hard work and neighbors helping neighbors. Because the contest shines the spotlight on dedicated Veterans who continue to serve our nation, Cabot was honored to be a part of this program. 
 
Cabot farmer Jenni Tilton-Flood puts it this way: ""We hear the word ""Heroes"" a lot these days but what we don't hear enough is THANK YOU. So thank you, from my farm family to the winners for the commitment and continued dedication to duty, service, leadership, and inspiration your selflessness and compassion provides for all of us. Our communities, our Nation, and our world looks to Veterans like you who continue to embody the best of what we can be and achieve. Our farmer gratitude knows no limits for your deeds and work.” 
 
Along with the folks at Cabot, we send our thanks and gratitude to all the Veterans who inspire us with the passion and dedication to making their communities better, one volunteer hour at a time.

Randall has been working at Alliant Energy for nine months. He also interned with us during the summer of 2019. An AP physics teacher in high school introduced Randall to engineering. Once he entered college, he joined the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), which further cemented his engineering career goals. Randall said the reason he chose Alliant Energy for both his internship and job had a lot to do with the welcoming environment. Randall said he believes Alliant Energy’s workers truly demonstrate the company’s values. “At Alliant Energy, every day is an opportunity to learn and improve upon what I do,” said Randall. Randall is an Engineer I in the Delivery System Planning department for the Burlington, Keokuk, Ottumwa and Washington zones. His primary function is to provide long-range plans and recommendations for the electrical distribution system to accommodate growth and increase system reliability and robustness. Engineering is special to Randall because he believes an engineer’s core purpose is to create solutions to various problems. He said every project is like a new canvas to work with. “Behind a strong community is a strong electrical grid; most of us depend heavily on power,” said Randall. “I feel that my work helps contribute to creating and maintaining that healthy backbone, so customers and communities can flip the light switch with confidence!” Randall’s advice to aspiring engineers is to have a positive attitude, embrace challenges and have an open mind toward each situation because life’s circumstances are not all homogenous.

In 2015, Connie started at Alliant Energy as an intern with Delivery System Planning West and was able to extend her internship through her last school year. In 2016, she then started full-time with the same team following her graduation. Growing up on the island of Guam was what sparked her inspiration to become an engineer. She said she was especially interested in how the citizens of Guam could become less reliant on imported diesel and use more of their own surrounding resources to power the island. After a Navy recruiter came to her class one day and discussed the various engineering roles in the Navy, the rest was history. Connie chose to intern and work at Alliant Energy because of the company culture. She said she enjoys the various people she gets to collaborate with and learn from. Connie and her team model their distribution electric grid to identify any potential issues today (thermal, voltage, etc.) and issues and growth that we may see in the future. They then work with the rest of the engineering teams and their operations teams (including internal teams and external utility partners) to identify solutions to be able to provide customers with exceptional service. Being challenged every day, thinking of ways to utilize new technologies and collaborating with her team members are all the best parts about being an engineer, according to Connie. Not only does she embrace our company values in the workplace by actively trying to make things better, do the right thing and act for tomorrow, she also embraces these values in her personal life by giving back to the community.

Here’s what he had to say: My journey to science was not a straightforward one. Before graduate school, I actually had a professional life working in music, which is what I studied as an undergrad at Brown University. As a violinist, I gigged and taught middle school, and I also worked in artist management and publishing. Music teaches you the value of patience, consistency, and collaboration, all things I bring to my work as a scientist now. Although I enjoyed teaching and making music, I ultimately decided to pursue my other vocational interest, science, in the hope of making a meaningful contribution to cancer research. During my Ph.D. work at Vanderbilt University, I studied breast tumor immunology. Although I found the academic work both fascinating and rewarding, I decided to pivot to a career in biotech to have a practical and more direct impact on patients’ lives. #wearebiotech At Amgen, I work in the biomarker discovery group, looking for new therapeutic targets for medicines. Currently, I feel as though I align with our core value “Be Ethical” the most. Being new, I try my best to be as transparent as possible with my boss and team about how I conduct research and my scientific results. Black History Month has always been a time for me to reflect on my community’s culture and history, and how it has shaped this country. While I personally celebrate Black culture and history year-round, in February, I make a more concerted effort to participate in community focused events and presentations where I live.",https://www.facebook.com/amgenbiotech/photos/a.1682384018594027/1929663770532716/?type=3,,"""Before graduate school, actually had a professional life working in music, which is what /studied as an undergrad at Brown University.""

In this episode of CVS Health Live, our expert panel will address important aspects of this issue, including understanding the role of racism and historical injustices in present-day distrust, and the steps that health care providers and the industry can take to improve trust in the COVID-19 vaccines and in the health care system overall.

With the Kleenex® 'Every Step Counts' program, the brand removed all plastic collars from boxes in the UK and introduced 30% post-consumer recycled content (PCR) in its multipack compact boxes. As part of the ‘Tiniest Footprint’ program, Huggies® introduced a new biodegradable baby wipe in its Pure range and reduced plastic content in all of its wipes, as well as introducing 30% PCR in its DryNites® packaging. Andrex® committed to a “Greener PawPrint” by removing all plastic handles from wrapped packs, introducing 30% PCR in its packaging, and making the packaging recyclable on flushable wipes.

During their initial conversation, Connor offered candid observations about the company’s Diversity, Equity and Inclusion progress, helping David to become an even better ally. And he says the experience equally benefits him. Being able to connect with an experienced executive teaches Connor valuable lessons about leadership and effective communication, skills that he now applies to his role as a Financial Lines Senior Underwriter. This has given him the confidence to more clearly advise his broker partners and valued clients through a challenging market environment. He’s also paying these lessons forward. As President of the Georgia Black Professionals & Allies Employee Resource Group (ERG), one of seven such groups globally at AIG, Connor helps to organize professional development programs that advance the careers of his Black colleagues. In Connor’s wide-ranging discussion with David, the two covered topics like networking and their love of professional football. And they also spoke openly about diversity in the workplace, specifically on how to create a more inclusive culture at AIG. “Through our conversation, I learned the importance of active listening.” As an ERG leader, Connor says he tries to model this behavior and that by really listening to the concerns of his ERG members and the rest of the AIG community, he’s building lasting relationships that will cultivate a more diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace. For Connor, the opportunity to build a relationship with one of AIG’s most senior leaders is helping to shape his insurance career, and is a benefit he didn’t expect when he first started at AIG. “The fact that we can have an honest conversation makes it all the more worthwhile. As a result, I’ve started to become an ally to others and am seeking out more mentorships.” #Diversity #Inclusion #LifeatAIG",https://www.facebook.com/AIGInsurance/photos/a.1653702814888496/2861240850801347/?type=3,,,Timeline Photos,,,,,37.61

Read about our next featured historical figure below. After witnessing an accident between a horse-drawn carriage and an automobile, Garrett Morgan dreamed up a three-position traffic signal that was patented in 1923. The invention saved lives in a time when horses, cars, and people all shared the roads in a rather chaotic way. Garrett also received a patent in 1912 for his safety hood and smoke protector, a precursor to the gas mask we use today. He created the hood to enhance the safety of firefighters and rescue crews. The invention earned him the first prize at the Second International Exposition of Safety and Sanitation in New York City.

What makes this poundcake special is when it goes to the table, we get to share that story.” Edouardo J. sees his role as more than a chef, he is an educator and historian. He brings Black Boy Joy to Facebook as he shares everything from new culinary adventures to foraging ingredients in the forest with his son. “The worst thing we can do is create history without understanding history. That’s the biggest thing that I’m teaching my son,” says Edouardo J. “Restaurants are for restoring the soul. I tell the stories of my mom, my grandmother, my uncles and ancestors.

The significance of Black History Month this year, for me, lies in the opportunity to educate and foster understanding for all, hopefully leading to healing for those seeking.”- Kenneth Johnson, Director of Business Relationship Management, D&S Finance & Sourcing IT",https://www.facebook.com/AmerisourceBergen/photos/a.211064345570705/5449287508415003/?type=3,,"AmerisourceBergen celebrates Black History Month Kenneth Johnson Director of Business Relationship Management, D&S Finance & Sourcing IT",Timeline Photos,,,,,-1.65

Daily Table was created with a simple goal: to make affordable and healthy food accessible to all. This nonprofit grocer, based in Dorchester, MA, uses donations and surplus products to offer its clients access to healthy food choices, enabling them to take control of their diets and provide for their families. Each month, Daily Table sells 1 million servings of dairy, produce, prepared foods, meat, poultry, fish, and dry goods, and their commissary kitchen prepares 20,000 fresh Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)-eligible ""heat and eat"" meals. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Daily Table has been helping those with financial challenges afford healthy food at an average savings of 30%. It also launched a new grocery delivery service that allows immune-suppressed individuals, seniors, and school-age children to get the healthy food they need. As one of our 2021 Champions in Action, Daily Table will receive $35,000 in unrestricted funds and a complimentary membership to the Massachusetts Nonprofit Network.

Every hospital prepares for worst-case scenarios, and that preparation has saved lives. When disaster strikes, we are there, ready and willing to give our time, expertise and support to help our friends and neighbors. HCA Houston Healthcare North Cypress colleagues brought this to life during last week’s historic winter storm. With many outpatient dialysis facilities forced to close due to the power outages and water shortages, the hospital’s dialysis units ran 24 hours per day. HCA Healthcare dialysis nurse Min Zhao was among the many colleagues who served as a beacon of hope for the influx of dialysis patients at her hospital. HCA Houston Healthcare North Cypress also provided sterile processing of surgical instrumentation for peer hospitals in the region that weren’t able to do their own because of the boil water requirement. To ensure caregivers and hospital staff arrived safely to care for our patients, nearby hotels were provided for colleagues like medical-surgical unit nurses Maria Alcantar and Jamie Craig until the extreme winter weather subsided.

""We were a player and had developed our own identity within the industry, but needed independence to fully realize it,” recalled CEO Adena Friedman. In 2001, Nasdaq filed its official application to register as an independent national securities exchange with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and about a year later, the SEC formally approved Nasdaq’s application to become a registered national securities exchange, which allowed Nasdaq to begin operations as a self-regulatory organization and fully divest itself from the NASD’s control. At long last, Nasdaq was an independent, shareholder-owned company with the freedom to realize its full potential within the financial industry.
